Python script to update DNS A record of your domain dynamically using gandi.net LiveDNS API:

http://doc.livedns.gandi.net/

The script was developed for those behind a dynamic IP interface (e.g. home server/pi/nas).

Forked by Rich McAllister (k6rfm) with the intention of supporting ipv6 (setting AAAA records.)

The config-template.txt file should be renamed to config.txt, and modified with your gandi.net API key, domain name, and A-record (@, dev, home, pi, etc).

Every time the script runs, it will query an external service to retrieve the external IP of the machine, compare it to the current A record in the zone at gandi.net, and then update the record if the IP has changed.

Requirements:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

You can then run the script as a cron job :

```
*/15 * * * * python /home/user/gandi_ddns.py
```

macOS

```
cd gandi-ddns
ln -s $(pwd) /usr/local/gandi-ddns
sudo cp gandi.ddns.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
sudo launchctl /Library/LaunchDaemons/gandi.ddns.plist
```
